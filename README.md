### Local installation

We recommend to install Marp CLI into your Node.js project. You may control the CLI version (and engine if you want) exactly.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @marp-team/marp-cli
```

The installed `marp` command is available in [npm-scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) or `npx marp`.

> [!NOTE]
> Marp CLI is working only with [actively supported Node.js versions](https://endoflife.date/nodejs), so Node.js v18 and later is required when installing into your Node.js project.

#### Global installation

You can install with `-g` option if you want to use `marp` command globally.

```bash
npm install -g @marp-team/marp-cli
```

### [Standalone binary][releases]

We also provide standalone binaries for Linux, macOS (Apple Silicon), and Windows. These have bundled Marp CLI with Node.js binary, so no need to install Node.js separately.

**[‚è© Download the latest standalone binary from release page.][releases]**

[releases]: https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli/releases

## Basic usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Several kind of conversions with üåê icon require to install any of compatible browsers, [Google Chrome], [Microsoft Edge], or [Mozilla Firefox]. When an unexpected problem has occurred while converting, please update your browser to the latest version. Check out [browser options](#browser-options) too.

### Convert to HTML

The passed markdown will be converted to HTML file by default. In the below example, a converted `slide-deck.html` will output to the same directory.

```bash
marp slide-deck.md
```

You can change the output path by `--output` (`-o`) option.

```bash
marp slide-deck.md -o output.html
```

Marp CLI supports converting multiple files by passing multiple paths, directories, and glob patterns. In this case, `--output` option cannot use.

When you want to output the converted result to another directory with keeping the origin directory structure, you can use `--input-dir` (`-I`) option. `--output` option would be available for specify the output directory.

### Convert to PDF (`--pdf`) üåê

If you passed `--pdf` option or the output filename specified by `--output` (`-o`) option ends with `.pdf`, Marp CLI will try to convert Markdown into PDF file through the browser.

```bash
marp --pdf slide-deck.md
marp slide-deck.md -o converted.pdf
```

#### PDF output options

- **`--pdf-notes`**: Add PDF note annotations to the lower left when the slide page has [Marpit presenter notes].
- **`--pdf-outlines`**: Add PDF outlines/bookmarks.

`--pdf-outlines` will make outlines based on slide pages and Markdown headings by default. If necessary, you may prevent making outlines from one of them, by setting `--pdf-outlines.pages=false` or `--pdf-outlines.headings=false`.

### Convert to PowerPoint document (`--pptx`) üåê

Do you want more familiar way to present and share your deck? PPTX conversion to create PowerPoint document is available by passing `--pptx` option or specify the output path with PPTX extension.

```bash
marp --pptx slide-deck.md
marp slide-deck.md -o converted.pptx
```

A created PPTX includes rendered Marp slide pages and the support of [Marpit presenter notes]. It can open with PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides, LibreOffice Impress, and so on...

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marp-team/marp-cli/main/docs/images/pptx.png" height="300" />
</p>

> [!WARNING]
>
> A converted PPTX consists of pre-rendered images. Please note that **contents would not be able to modify** or re-use in PowerPoint.

### Convert to PNG/JPEG image(s) üåê

#### Multiple images (`--images`)

You can convert the slide deck into multiple images when specified `--images [png|jpeg]` option.

```bash
# Convert into multiple PNG image files
marp --images png slide-deck.md

# Convert into multiple JPEG image files
marp --images jpeg slide-deck.md
```

Output files have a suffix of page number, like `slide-deck.001.png`, `slide-deck.002.png`, and so on.

#### Title slide (`--image`)

When you passed `--image` option or specified the output path with PNG/JPEG extension, Marp CLI will convert _only the first page (title slide)_ of the targeted slide deck into an image.

```bash
# Convert the title slide into an image
marp --image png slide-deck.md
marp slide-deck.md -o output.png
```

It would be useful for creating [Open Graph] image that can specify with [`image` global directive and `--og-image` option](#metadata).

#### Scale factor

You can set the scale factor for rendered image(s) through `--image-scale` option. It is useful for making high-resolution image from the slide.

```bash
# Generate high-resolution image of the title slide
marp slide-deck.md -o title-slide@2x.png --image-scale 2
```

> [!TIP]
>
> `--image-scale` is not affect to the actual size of presentation.
>
> The scale factor is also available for PPTX conversion. By default, Marp CLI will use `2` as the default scale factor in PPTX, to suppress deterioration of slide rendering in full-screen presentation.

### Export presenter notes (`--notes`)

You can export [presenter notes][marpit presenter notes] in Marp / Marpit Markdown as a text file by using `--notes` option or specifying the output path with TXT extension.

```bash
# Export presenter notes as a text
marp --notes slide-deck.md
marp slide-deck.md -o output.txt
```

### Security about local files

Because of [the security reason](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli/pull/10#user-content-security), **conversion that is using the browser cannot use local files by default.**

Marp CLI would output incomplete result with warning if the blocked local file accessing is detected. We recommend uploading your assets to online.

If you really need to use local files in these conversion, `--allow-local-files` option helps to find your local files. _Please use only to the trusted Markdown because there is a potential security risk._

```bash
marp --pdf --allow-local-files slide-deck.md
```

## Conversion modes

### Watch mode (`--watch` / `-w`) <a name="watch-mode"></a>

Marp CLI will observe a change of Markdown and using theme CSS when passed with `--watch` (`-w`) option. The conversion will be triggered whenever the content of file is updated.

While you are opening the converted HTML in browser, it would refresh the opened page automatically.

### Server mode (`--server` / `-s`)

Server mode supports on-demand conversion by HTTP request. We require to pass `--server` (`-s`) option and a directory to serve.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marp-team/marp-cli/main/docs/images/server-mode.gif" />
</p>

In this mode, the converted file outputs as the result of accessing to server, and not to disk.

You would get the converted PDF, PPTX, PNG, JPEG, and TXT by adding corresponded query string when requesting. e.g. `http://localhost:8080/deck-a.md?pdf` returns converted PDF.

> [!TIP]
>
> You can set the server port by setting the environment variable `PORT`. For example, `PORT=5000 marp -s ./slides` would listen on port number 5000.

#### `index.md` / `PITCHME.md`

Marp CLI server will provide the list of served files by default, but you can place the default Markdown deck like a common web server's `index.html`.

Place Markdown named `index.md` or `PITCHME.md` ([GitPitch style](https://gitpitch.github.io/gitpitch/#/conventions/pitchme-md)) to served directory. It would be redirected just accessing to `http://localhost:8080/`.

### Preview window (`--preview` / `-p`)

When conversions were executed together with `--preview` (`-p`) option, Marp CLI will open preview window(s) to check the converted result immediately.

Unlike opening with browser, you may present deck with the immersive window.
[Watch mode](#watch-mode) is automatically enabled while using preview window.

> [!NOTE]
>
> `--preview` option cannot use when you are using Marp CLI through official Docker image.

## Browser options

### Choose browser (`--browser`)

You can specify the kind of browser for conversion by `--browser` option. Available browsers are `chrome`, `edge`, and `firefox`. If set comma-separated browsers, Marp CLI will try to use the first available browser among them.

```bash
# Use Firefox for image conversion
marp --browser firefox ./slide.md -o slide.png

# Prefer to use Firefox first, then Chrome
marp --browser firefox,chrome ./slide.md -o slide.png
```

The default is a special value `auto`, which means to use the first available browser from `chrome,edge,firefox`.

> [!WARNING]
>
> _Firefox support is still early stage._ The PDF output generated by Firefox may include some incompatible renderings compared to the PDF generated by Chrome.

### Browser path (`--browser-path`)

If you have a browser binary that cannot find out by Marp CLI automatically, you can explicitly set the path to the browser executable through `--browser-path` option.

```bash
# Use Chromium-flavored browser (Chromium, Brave, Vivaldi, etc...)
marp --browser-path /path/to/chromium-flavored-browser ./slide.md -o slide.pdf

# Use Firefox with explicitly set path
marp --browser firefox --browser-path /path/to/firefox ./slide.md -o slide.png
```

### Other browser options

- **`--browser-protocol`**: Set the preferred protocol for connecting to the browser.
  - `cdp`: [Chrome DevTools Protocol][cdp] (default)
  - `webdriver-bidi`: [WebDriver BiDi]
- **`--browser-timeout`**: Set the timeout for each browser operation in seconds. (default: `30` seconds)

[cdp]: https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/
[webdriver bidi]: https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/

## Template

You can choose a built-in HTML templates by `--template` option. Default template is `bespoke`.

```bash
marp --template bespoke slide-deck.md
```

### `bespoke` template (default)

The `bespoke` template is using [Bespoke.js](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke) as the name implies. It has several features to be useful in a real presentation. A few features may control by CLI options.

#### Features

- **Navigation**: Navigate the deck through keyboard and swipe geasture.
- **Fullscreen**: Toggle fullscreen by hitting <kbd>f</kbd> / <kbd>F11</kbd> key.
- **On-screen controller**: There is a touch-friendly OSC. You may also disable by `--bespoke.osc=false` if unneccesary.
- **Fragmented list**: Recognize [Marpit's fragmented list](https://github.com/marp-team/marpit/issues/145) and appear list one-by-one if used `*` and `1)` as the bullet marker.
- **Presenter view**: Open presenter view in external window by hitting <kbd>p</kbd> key. (It may become disabled when not fulfilled requirements for working)
- **Progress bar** (optional): By setting `--bespoke.progress` option, you can add a progress bar on the top of the deck.
- [**Slide transitions**][transitions]: Support transitions (`transition` local directive) powered by [View Transitions API].

[transitions]: ./docs/bespoke-transitions/README.md

  </a>
</p>

### `bare` template

The `bare` template is a primitive template, and there is no extra features. It only has minimum assets to give your presentation with browser.

#### Zero-JS slide deck

When [the conversion engine is changed to Marpit framework by setting `engine` option](#use-marpit-framework), _it would not use any scripts._ Even then, it has enough to use for the browser-based presentation.

```bash
marp --template bare --engine @marp-team/marpit slide-deck.md
```

## Metadata

Through [global directives] or CLI options, you can set metadata for a converted HTML, PDF, and PPTX slide deck.

| [Global directives] |   CLI option    | Description                     | Available in    |
| :-----------------: | :-------------: | :------------------------------ | :-------------- |
|       `title`       |    `--title`    | Define title of the slide deck  | HTML, PDF, PPTX |
|    `description`    | `--description` | Define description of the slide | HTML, PDF, PPTX |
|      `author`       |   `--author`    | Define author of the slide deck | HTML, PDF, PPTX |
|     `keywords`      |  `--keywords`   | Define comma-separated keywords | HTML, PDF       |
|        `url`        |     `--url`     | Define [canonical URL]          | HTML            |
|       `image`       |  `--og-image`   | Define [Open Graph] image URL   | HTML            |

[canonical url]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element
[open graph]: http://ogp.me/

### By [global directives]

Marp CLI supports _additional [global directives]_ to specify metadata in Markdown. You can define meta values in Markdown front-matter.

```markdown
---
title: Marp slide deck
description: An example slide deck created by Marp CLI
author: Yuki Hattori
keywords: marp,marp-cli,slide
url: https://marp.app/
image: https://marp.app/og-image.jpg
---

# Marp slide deck
```

[global directives]: https://marpit.marp.app/directives?id=global-directives-1

### By CLI option

Marp CLI prefers CLI option to global directives. You can override metadata values by `--title`, `--description`, `--author`, `--keywords`, `--url`, and `--og-image`.

## Theme

### Override theme

You can override theme you want to use by `--theme` option. For example to use [Gaia](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/tree/main/themes#gaia) built-in theme in Marp Core:

```bash
marp --theme gaia
```

### Use custom theme

A custom theme created by user also can use easily by passing the path of CSS file.

```bash
marp --theme custom-theme.css
```

> [!TIP]
>
> [Marpit theme CSS requires `@theme` meta comment](https://marpit.marp.app/theme-css?id=metadata) in regular use, but it's not required in this usage.

### Theme set

`--theme-set` option has to specify theme set composed by multiple theme CSS files. The registed themes are usable in [Marpit's `theme` directive](https://marpit.marp.app/directives?id=theme).

```bash
# Multiple theme CSS files
marp --theme-set theme-a.css theme-b.css theme-c.css -- deck-a.md deck-b.md

# Theme directory
marp --theme-set ./themes -- deck.md
```

## Engine

Marp CLI is calling the [Marpit framework](https://marpit.marp.app/) based converter as "Engine". Normally we use the bundled [Marp Core](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core), but you may swap the conversion engine to another Marpit based engine through `--engine` option.

You can use Marp (and compatible markdown-it) plugins while converting, or completely swap the converter to the other Marpit-based engine which published to npm.

### Use Marpit framework

For example, you can convert Markdown with using the pure Marpit framework.

```bash
# Install Marpit framework
npm i @marp-team/marpit

# Specify engine to use Marpit
marp --engine @marp-team/marpit marpit-deck.md
```

Notice that Marpit has not provided theme. It would be good to include inline style in Markdown, or pass CSS file by `--theme` option.

> [!TIP]
>
> If you want to use the Marpit-based custom engine by the module name, the specified module must be exporting a class inherited from Marpit as the default export.

### Functional engine

When you specified the path to JavaScript file (`.js`, `.cjs`, or `.mjs`) in `--engine` option, you may use more customized engine by a JavaScript function.

#### Spec

The functional engine should export a function as the default export, which should have a single argument representing [the constructor option of Marpit](https://marpit-api.marp.app/marpit)/[Marp Core](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core#constructor-options).

The function must return a class inherited from Marpit, or an instance of Marpit-based engine made by the parameter passed by argument.

```javascript
// engine.mjs (ES modules)
import { MarpitBasedEngine } from 'marpit-based-engine'

export default () => MarpitBasedEngine // Return a class inherited from Marpit
```

```javascript
// engine.cjs (CommonJS)
const { MarpitBasedEngine } = require('marpit-based-engine')

module.exports = function (constructorOptions) {
  // Return an instance of Marpit initialized by passed constructor options
  return new MarpitBasedEngine(constructorOptions)
}
```

This function can return [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) object so you can use [async function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) too.

```javascript
export default async (constructorOptions) => {
  const { MarpitBasedEngine } = await import('marpit-based-engine')
  return new MarpitBasedEngine(constructorOptions)
}
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> Currently ES Modules can resolve only when using Marp CLI via Node.js. [The standalone binary](#standalone-binary) cannot resolve ESM. ([vercel/pkg#1291](https://github.com/vercel/pkg/issues/1291))

#### `marp` getter property

Marp CLI also exposes `marp` getter property to the parameter. It returns a prepared instance of the built-in Marp Core engine, so you can apply several customizations to Marp engine with simple declarations.

```javascript
const marpPlugin = require('marp-plugin-foo')
const andMorePlugin = require('marp-plugin-bar')

module.exports = ({ marp }) => marp.use(marpPlugin).use(andMorePlugin)
```

It allows converting Markdown with additional syntaxes that were provided by Marp (or compatible markdown-it) plugins.

#### Example: [markdown-it-mark](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-mark)

```javascript
// engine.mjs
import markdownItMark from 'markdown-it-mark'

export default ({ marp }) => marp.use(markdownItMark)
```

```bash
# Install markdown-it-mark into your project
npm i markdown-it-mark --save

# Specify the path to functional engine
marp --engine ./engine.mjs slide-deck.md
```

The customized engine will convert `==marked==` to `<mark>marked</mark>`.

### Confirm engine version

By using `--version` (`-v`) option, you may confirm the version of engine that is expected to use in current configuration.

```console
$ marp --version
@marp-team/marp-cli v41.x.x (w/ @marp-team/marp-core v4.x.x)
```

### Use specific version of Marp Core

Marp CLI prefers to use _an installed core to local project by user_ than the bundled.

If the current project has installed `@marp-team/marp-core` individually, it would show its version and the annotation: `w/ user-installed @marp-team/marp-core vX.X.X` or `w/ customized engine`.

```console
$ npm i @marp-team/marp-cli @marp-team/marp-core@^4.0.0 --save-dev
$ npx marp --version
@marp-team/marp-cli v4.x.x (w/ user-installed @marp-team/marp-core v4.0.0)
```

## Configuration file

Marp CLI can be configured options with file, such as `marp.config.js`, `marp.config.mjs` (ES Modules), `marp.config.cjs` (CommonJS), `.marprc` (JSON / YAML), and `marp` section of `package.json`.

It is useful to configure settings for the whole of project.

```javascript
// package.json
{
  "marp": {
    "inputDir": "./slides",
    "output": "./public",
    "themeSet": "./themes"
  }
}
```

```yaml
# .marprc.yml
allowLocalFiles: true
options:
  looseYAML: false
  markdown:
    breaks: false
pdf: true
```

```javascript
// marp.config.mjs
import markdownItContainer from 'markdown-it-container'

export default {
  // Customize engine on configuration file directly
  engine: ({ marp }) => marp.use(markdownItContainer, 'custom'),
}
```

By default we use configuration file that is placed on current directory, but you may also specify the path for a configuration file by `--config-file` (`--config` / `-c`) option.

If you want to prevent looking up a configuration file, you can pass `--no-config-file` (`--no-config`) option.

[the whitelist object]: https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core#html-boolean--object

Some of options that cannot specify through CLI options can be configured by file. (e.g. `options` field for the constructor option of used engine)

<details>
<summary>Example: Customize engine's constructor option</summary>

You can fine-tune constructor options for the engine, [Marp Core](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core#constructor-options) / [Marpit](https://marpit-api.marp.app/marpit).

```json
{
  "options": {
    "markdown": {
      "breaks": false
    },
    "minifyCSS": false
  }
}
```

This configuration will set the constructor option for Marp Core as specified:

- Disables [Marp Core's line breaks conversion](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core#marp-markdown) (`\n` to `<br />`) to match for CommonMark, by passing [markdown-it's `breaks` option](https://markdown-it.github.io/markdown-it/#MarkdownIt.new) as `false`.
- Disable minification for rendered theme CSS to make debug your style easily, by passing [`minifyCSS`](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core#minifycss-boolean) as `false`.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Some options may be overridden by used template.

</details>

### Auto completion

For getting the power of auto completion for the config, such as [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense), you can annotate the config object through JSDoc, with Marp CLI's `Config` type.

```javascript
/** @type {import('@marp-team/marp-cli').Config} */
const config = {
  // ...
}

export default config
```

Or you can use Vite-like `defineConfig` helper from Marp CLI instead.

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from '@marp-team/marp-cli'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
})
```

#### `Config` type with custom engine

If you've swapped the engine into another Marpit based engine, you can provide better suggestion for `options` field by passing the engine type to generics.

```javascript
/** @type {import('@marp-team/marp-cli').Config<typeof import('@marp-team/marpit').Marpit>} */
const config = {
  engine: '@marp-team/marpit',
  options: {
    // Suggest only Marpit constructor options, not Marp Core
  },
}

export default config
```

#### TypeScript (`marp.config.ts`)

If you installed `typescript` into your local project together with Marp CLI, you can write a config by TypeScript `marp.config.ts`. Marp CLI will try to transpile `.ts` with the project configuration `tsconfig.json`.

In TypeScript configuration, you can specify the custom engine as the generics for `defineConfig` helper, like this:

```typescript
// marp.config.ts
import { Marpit } from '@marp-team/marpit'
import { defineConfig } from '@marp-team/marp-cli'

export default defineConfig<typeof Marpit>({
  engine: Marpit,
  options: {
    // Suggest only Marpit constructor options
  },
})
```

## API _(EXPERIMENTAL)_

You can use Marp CLI through Node.js [if installed Marp CLI into your local project](#local-installation).

```js
const { marpCli } = require('@marp-team/marp-cli')

marpCli(['test.md', '--pdf'])
  .then((exitStatus) => {
    if (exitStatus > 0) {
      console.error(`Failure (Exit status: ${exitStatus})`)
    } else {
      console.log('Success')
    }
  })
  .catch(console.error)
```

`marpCli()` accepts an argument of CLI options as array, and returns `Promise` to resolve an expected exit status in CLI. It would be rejected with the instance of `Error` if CLI met an error to suspend the conversion process.

### Error handling

We have exported [`CLIError` class and `CLIErrorCode` enum](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli/blob/main/src/error.ts) from `@marp-team/marp-cli`, to allow handling for specific errors that have already known by Marp CLI.

If `CLIError` instance was thrown, you can identify the reason why CLI throwed error by checking `errorCode` member.

### Wait for observation

`marpCli()` would not be resolved initiatively if started some observation: Watch mode, server mode, and preview window.

`waitForObservation()` is helpful to handle them. It returns `Promise` that would be resolved with helper object when ready to observe resources in `marpCli()`.

```javascript
const { marpCli, waitForObservation } = require('@marp-team/marp-cli')

marpCli(['--server', './slides/'])
  .then((exitCode) => console.log(`Done with exit code ${exitCode}`))
  .catch(console.error)

waitForObservation().then(({ stop }) => {
  console.log('Observed')

  // Stop observations to resolve marpCli()'s Promise
  stop()
})
```

The resolved helper has `stop()` method for telling Marp CLI to stop observation and resolve `Promise`.
